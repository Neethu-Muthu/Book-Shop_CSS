                William Shakespeare
                <p> <img src="/home/neethu/CSS/BOOK_SHOP/img/anna.jpeg" style="float: right;"> was an English
                    playwright, poet and actor.
                    He is widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent
                    dramatist.He is often called England's national poet and the "Bard of Avon".His extant works,
                    including collaborations, consist of some 39 plays, 154 sonnets, three long narrative poems, and a
                    few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major
                    living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright. Shakespeare remains
                    arguably the most influential writer in the English language, and his works continue to be studied
                    and reinterpreted.</p><br><br>
